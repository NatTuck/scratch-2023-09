## Code

 - Implements our app

## Test Code

 - Makes sure the app code works
 
Why?

 - Acts as a specification.
 - Tests avoid regressions. Otherwise, future changes
   might break existing functionality.
 - Help make dynamic typing reliable.
 - Allow for continuous deployment by providing a definition
   of "working".


Kinds of tests:

 - Unit tests test a small chunk of code.
   - e.g. one function
 - Integration tests test slices of the whole application
   working together.
   - e.g. one user story / workflow
