# Lecture 37: Second to Last Friday

 - Check your grades on Inkfish
   - If they're wrong and we don't fix them, you'll get a wrong grade.
   - Can't (usually, easily) fix grades after final grades are submitted.
   - Send email with simple, obvious fixes.
   - Visit office hours next week for more complex fixes.
   - All grades except final exam should be correct by final block.
