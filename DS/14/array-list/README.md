
# Stack

A sequence type.

One big restriction: we can only access items
from one end: the top.

Four operations:

 - push - Add an item to the top
 - pop - Remove the top item and return it
 - peek - Look at top item without removing it
 - empy - Is stack empty?

With a Linked List, all four operations
can be done in O(1) time.
