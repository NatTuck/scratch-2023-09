# Balanced Binary Search Trees

 - A tree of n items is balanced if its height is O(log n).
 - Alt: For some constant k (think 2), the longest path from root to
   leaf will always be no more than k times (twice) the length
   of the minimum length path.
 - We can easily get an unbalanced tree by inserting items
   in order. This tree will have height O(n).
